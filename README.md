# Unique Integers Assignment

This program solves the problem of finding unique and sorted integers from a file using Python.

## Problem Statement

Given a file containing a list of integers, the program should output a list of unique and sorted integers from the file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `wise_men_from_Africa.py` file.
3. Create a file named `integers.txt` in the same directory as the `wise_men_from_Africa.py` file.
4. Populate the `unuqueInt.txt` file with a list of integers, each on a separate line.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `wise_men_from_Africa.py` file is located.
6. Run the program by executing the following command:

// python wise_men_from_Africa.py


7. The program will read the integers from the `uniqueInt.txt` file and output a list of unique and sorted integers to the console.
